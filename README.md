Portfolio Website
=================

This is a personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, experiences, and projects. It's built using a combination of ReactJS, Node.JS, Chakra.UI, MUI, and SCSS.

Getting Started
---------------

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
-   Basic understanding of ReactJS, Node.JS, Chakra.UI, MUI, and SCSS.

### Installing

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

* `git clone https://github.com/Ascendrospyder/Portfolio.git`

2.  Navigate into the project directory:

* `cd Portfolio`

3.  Install the necessary dependencies for the frontend:

* `npm install`

Running the Application
-----------------------

To start the application in development mode without any magic from the backend, use the following command:

`npm start`


This will start the application and open it in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The page will reload if you make edits. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Running the Backend
-------------------

The backend of the application is separate and needs to be started separately to use the contact form. Navigate to the backend directory, install the necessary packages, and run the server:

1. `cd backend `
2. `npm install`
3. `cd src`
4. `node index.js`

Technologies Used
-----------------

-   [ReactJS](https://react.dev/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page.
-   [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en): A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It's used to run JavaScript on the server side.
-   [Chakra.UI](https://chakra-ui.com/): A simple, modular, and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications .
-   [MUI](https://mui.com/): A popular Material Design framework for React. It provides a set of React components that implement Google's Material Design.
-   [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/): A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It's used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.
-   [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/): A production-ready motion library for React. It's used to create animations and transitions in the application
